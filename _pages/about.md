As part of my research, I make use of theoretical tools, idealized
process models, realistic numerical circulation models, and field
measurements. Research topics in recent years have included Atlantic
and Southern Ocean dynamics; global and regional sea level variability
and change; transport of matter and energy by transient mesoscale and
submesoscale eddies; parameterizations of turbulent ocean stirring and
mixing; analysis methods aimed at viewing the ocean as a turbulent
fluid; and algorithms for ocean circulation models.  I maintain active
collaborations with scientists from around the world, most notably in
America, Australia, Europe, and India.

As a <a
href="https://aos.princeton.edu/people/faculty">lecturer,</a> mentor,
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html">book
author,</a> and <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/19422466/editorial-board/editorial-board">journal
editor,</a> I aim to foster a fundamental understanding of physical
concepts and their creative use in describing observed and simulated
ocean phenomena. Towards this aim, I strive to pedagogically
articulate the foundations of ocean fluid mechanics in both writing
and speaking.  I am particularly interested in revealing how concepts
and tools from mathematical physics can be leveraged to deepen our
understanding of the ocean, and for nurturing an appreciation of
geophysical fluid mechanics within the broader context of theoretical
physics.

I am interested in mentoring highly energetic students and post-docs
with a strong background in both mathematical physics and physical
oceanography.  Mentees should have a passionate desire to dive deep
into ocean physics through theoretical and computational analysis.
