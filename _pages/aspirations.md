# Ongoing Research Interests

In February 2026 I started a position at the
[IPSL/LOCEAN laboratory in Paris](https://www.locean.ipsl.fr/services-et-methodes/modelisation/)
working within the
[NEMO development team](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/).
The position offers the freedom to pursue a number of projects motivated
by curiosity-driven questions related to the fundamentals of ocean
physics, many of which have a direct impact on how we understand and
simulate the ocean as part of the Earth’s climate system.

<br><br>

During much of my career, I have been privileged to be able to pursue
a wide suite of research topics unconstrained by the usual boundaries
of research proposals and grants. Consequently, my research interests
are relatively broad, and they have been largely guided by intellectual
interests and the desire to collaborate with a variety of smart and
curious individuals.

<br><br>

In recent years, my interests have centered on the role of mathematical
physics in addressing fundamental questions of theoretical ocean
physics and ocean numerical modeling. The following is an incomplete
list of topics that I hope to pursue in the near future through
collaborations. I offer just a few words concerning these topics,
largely since they are aspirational and incompletely formed. Please
feel free to connect with me should you wish to collaborate. I have
funds to support one or two postdoctoral researchers in Paris as part
of LOCEAN. I also have funds for visits to Paris to support
collaborations.

## An incomplete list of research topics

- **Ocean waves and mean flows** using methods from quantum mechanics,
  Hamilton’s principle, and ray theory, as detailed in  
  [Tracy et al. (2014)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ray-tracing-and-beyond/706CC068AEF2FA5C84C48278FC449761).

- **Modal and non-modal instabilities**, with particular emphasis on
  nonlinear interactions in the presence of topography. Why do ocean
  physicists pay so little attention to non-normal growth, in contrast
  to atmospheric physicists? How can variational methods be used to
  study realistic ocean-flow stability problems in the presence of
  topography?

- **Coarse-graining methods** and their use in understanding multiscale
  interactions in geophysical turbulence, and in informing subgrid-scale
  parameterizations. How can we understand the role of linear and
  nonlinear interactions between the gyrescale, mesoscale, and
  submesoscale, and their influence on emergent properties of the ocean
  general circulation? This work builds on  
  [Storer et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33031-3) and  
  [Storer et al. (2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7420).

- **Theory of ocean mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence** that directly
  informs and constrains parameterizations for ocean circulation models.
  Can the ocean geostrophic turbulence problem be framed in terms of
  Hamilton’s variational principle, and can such an approach lead to
  meaningful advances in ocean circulation modeling? Recent efforts
  have focused on mechanical energy, often leaving out the importance
  of boundaries. Can potential vorticity play a useful role in such
  parameterizations, given the central importance of boundary
  processes?

- **Mathematical theory of watermass transformation** that applies
  across arbitrary coordinate systems, including potential vorticity.
  This question builds on an incomplete research path documented in  
  [Nurser et al. (2022)](https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10511370.2).

- **Hamilton’s principle and differential geometry in numerical
  modeling.** Recent advances suggest new approaches to formulating
  fluid mechanical models. Can such methods be used to formulate the
  ocean’s thermo-hydrodynamical equations in pursuit of the next
  generation of ocean circulation models?
