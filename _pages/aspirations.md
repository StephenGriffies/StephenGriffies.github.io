In Feb 2026 I began a new stage in my career with a position at the
LOCEAN laboratory in Paris working within the NEMO development
team. The position allows me to pursue any number of projects
motivated by curiosity driven questions related to the fundamentals of
ocean physics, many of which have a direct impact on how we understand
and simulate the ocean as a part of the Earth's climate system. I have
funds to support one or two postdoc researchers whose style, passions,
and interests mesh with mine.  Please feel free to reach out to me
should you wish to consider working in Paris with me and others in IPSL/LOCEAN.

# <center>Questions and methods that interest me</center>

<p align="justify">

 I am often asked what I hope to accomplish in the years I have
remaining in my career.  That question is tough to answer since I am
mostly focused on the present rather than the future.  Indeed, I have
been privileged to be able to pursue a wide suite of research topics
unconstrained by the usual boundaries of research proposals and
grants.  As a result, my research portfolio is rather broad, and it
has been largely guided by my intellectual interests and desire to
collaborate with a variety of smart and curious individuals.  I find
my interests of late to be centered on the role of mathematical
physics in the pursuit of fundamental questions of ocean physics and
ocean modeling.  With this perspective in mind, here is an incomplete
list of topics I hope to pursue in the near future through
collaborations. I offer just a few words concerning these topics,
largely since they are aspirational and incompletely formed.

## <center>Research Interests</center>

<p align="justify">

<ul>

<li>Ocean waves and mean flows using methods from quantum mechanics,
Hamilton's principle, and ray theory as detailed in <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ray-tracing-and-beyond/706CC068AEF2FA5C84C48278FC449761">
Tracy et al (2014) </a></li>

<li>Modal and non-modal instabilities, with particular emphasis on
nonlinear interactions in the presence of topography.  Why do ocean
physicists pay so little attention to non-normal growth, which
contrasts to atmospheric physicists? How can we make use of
variational methods for the study of realistic problems in ocean flow
stability in the presence of topography? </a></li>

<li>Coarse-graining methods and their use in understanding multiscale
interactions in geophysical turbulence, and informing subgrid scale
parameterizations.  This work also leads me to seek an understanding
of the relations between the gyrescale, mesoscale, and submesoscale,
and the role of linear and nonlinear interactions in affecting
emergent properties of the ocean general circulation.  This work
builds from work documented in the following papers <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33031-3"> Storer et
al (2022) </a> and <a
href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7420"> Storer et
al (2023) </a></li>

<li>Theory of ocean mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence that
directly informs and constrains parameterizations for ocean
circulation models. Can we frame the ocean geostrophic turbulence
problem in terms of Hamilton's variational principle, and if so can
that then lead to meaningful methods for ocean circulation models?
Recent efforts have focused on the role of mechanical energy to frame
closures.  But what about potential vorticity, with particular
emphasis on boundary processes? </a></li>

<li>Is there a general mathematical theory for watermass
transformation that embodies any and all coordinates, including
potential vorticity? This question builds from an incomplete research
path documented in <a
href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10511370.2">
this preprint.  </a></li>

<li>There have been some advances in the use of Hamilton’s principle
and differential geometry in formulating novel numerical methods for
fluid mechanical models.  Can such methods be used to formulate the
ocean’s thermo-hydrodynamical equations in pursuit of the next
generation of ocean circulation models?</a></li>
