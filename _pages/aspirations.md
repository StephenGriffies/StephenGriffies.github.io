In Feb 2026 I started a position at the <a
href="https://www.locean.ipsl.fr/services-et-methodes/modelisation/">
IPSL/LOCEAN laboratory in Paris </a> working within the <a
href="https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/"> NEMO development team. </a> The
position offers the freedom to pursue a number of projects motivated
by curiosity driven questions related to the fundamentals of ocean
physics, many of which have a direct impact on how we understand and
simulate the ocean as a part of the Earth's climate system.

# <center>Ongoing Research Interests</center>

<p align="justify">

During much of my career, I have been privileged to be able to pursue
a wide suite of research topics unconstrained by the usual boundaries
of research proposals and grants. Consequently, my research interests
are relatively broad, and they have been largely guided by
intellectual interests and the desire to collaborate with a variety of
smart and curious individuals. 

<br> <br>

In recent years, my interests have centered on the role of
mathematical physics in addressing fundamental questions of
theoretical ocean physics and ocean numerical modeling.  The following
is an incomplete list of topics that I hope to pursue in the near
future through collaborations. I offer just a few words concerning
these topics, largely since they are aspirational and incompletely
formed.  Please feel free to connect with me should you wish to
collaborate. I have funds to support one or two postdoc researchers in
Paris as part of LOCEAN.  I also have funds for visits to Paris to
support collaborations.

## <center>Research Interests</center>

<p align="justify">

<ul>

<li>Ocean waves and mean flows using methods from quantum mechanics,
Hamilton's principle, and ray theory as detailed in <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/ray-tracing-and-beyond/706CC068AEF2FA5C84C48278FC449761">
Tracy et al (2014) </a></li>

<li>Modal and non-modal instabilities, with particular emphasis on
nonlinear interactions in the presence of topography.  Why do ocean
physicists pay so little attention to non-normal growth, which
contrasts to atmospheric physicists? How can we make use of
variational methods for the study of realistic problems in ocean flow
stability in the presence of topography? </a></li>

<li>Coarse-graining methods and their use in understanding multiscale
interactions in geophysical turbulence, and informing subgrid scale
parameterizations.  How can we understand the role of linear and
nonlinear interactions between the gyrescale, mesoscale, and
submesoscale, and the role of these interactions in affecting emergent
properties of the ocean general circulation?  This work builds from
the following papers <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33031-3"> Storer et
al (2022) </a> and <a
href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi7420"> Storer et
al (2023) </a></li>

<li>Theory of ocean mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence that
directly informs and constrains parameterizations for ocean
circulation models. Can we frame the ocean geostrophic turbulence
problem in terms of Hamilton's variational principle, and if so can
that approach lead to meaningful methods for ocean circulation models?
Recent efforts have focused on the role of mechanical energy to frame
eddy closures. But that focus has largely left out the importance of
boundaries. Can potential vorticity be of use for such
parameterizations, given the particularly central role of boundary
processes? </a></li>

<li>Is there a general mathematical theory for watermass
transformation that embodies any and all coordinates, including
potential vorticity? This question builds from an incomplete research
path documented in <a
href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.1002/essoar.10511370.2">
this preprint.  </a></li>

<li>There have been some advances in the use of Hamilton’s principle
and differential geometry in formulating novel numerical methods for
fluid mechanical models. Can such methods be used to formulate the
ocean’s thermo-hydrodynamical equations in pursuit of the next
generation of ocean circulation models?</a></li>

</ul>
