<p align="justify">

This webpage provides links to an ongoing book project for the study
of Geophysical Fluid Mechanics.  Much more work remains, though I am
happy to receive feedback on any portion of the project.  In addition
to the text material, I have a solution manual for exercises that is
available upon request from teachers.
