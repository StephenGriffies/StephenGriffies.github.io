<p align="justify">

This webpage provides links to drafts of an ongoing book project that
aims to provide an intellectual foundation for the study of
Geophysical Fluid Mechanics.  It is an over-the-top project that has
been my passion for many years, with much more work
remaining. Feedback is welcome on any portion of the project.
Note that in addition to the text, this project offers a full solution
manual for teachers and students.
