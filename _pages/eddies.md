Since 2012, much of my research has made use of the GFDL climate model
CM2.6 and its ocean/sea-ice components.  CM2.6 is notable for
simulating a rich mesoscale eddy field due to the model 
0.1 degree ocean horizontal grid spacing.  Numerous research
scientists, including post-docs and graduate students, have used, and
continue to use, output from CM2.6 for research into the role of ocean
mesoscale eddies in the transport and ventilation of properties such
as heat, carbon, and nutrients.

Sample research questions that have been addressed with CM2.6 include:
<ul>
  <li>What is the impact on vertical ocean heat transport from the
  ocean mesoscal eddy field?

</ul>

complete list</a> of papers having used CM2.6 to address a huge
suite of ocean and climate research questions.
