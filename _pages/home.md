# <center> About this website</center> 

<p align="justify">

My name is Stephen Griffies and this website summarizes my research,
teaching, and mentoring activities.  I conduct scientific research in
ocean and climate physics at the <a
href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/">NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory,</a> with a focus on ocean fluid mechanics and the role of
the ocean in the earth climate system.  I also teach and mentor as a
faculty member in the <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University.
</a>

<br> <br>

As part of my research, teaching, and mentoring, I aim to foster an
inclusive, friendly, generous, patient, and non-judgmental space for
students, postdocs, and researchers.  Key principles that support this
space include equity, diversity and inclusion, each of which are
intrinsically valuable and an essential feature of ethical research
and education.  Practicing these principles serves to magnify the
educational and research potential of individuals, groups, and the
global scientific endeavor.  Cultivating this space supports
spontaneous brainstorming and deep learning while genuinely
appreciating contributions without regard to race, ethnicity, culture,
religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical
ability, age, socioeconomic status or nationality.  Each participant
in this space celebrates diversity and nutures an inclusive community
that is stronger, more resilient, and better able to produce
fundamental scientific advances that are effectively communicated to
the global community.

<br> <br>

You are invited to explore this website for an overview of my
activities and for opportunities to work with me as a graduate student,
post-doc, or visiting research scientist.
