# <center> About this website</center> 

<p align="justify">

My name is Stephen Griffies and this website summarizes my research,
teaching, and mentoring activities.


<br> <br>

I conduct scientific research in ocean and climate physics at the <a
href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/">NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory,</a> with a focus on ocean fluid mechanics and the role of
the ocean in the earth climate system.  I also teach and mentor as a
faculty member in the <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University.</a>


<br> <br>

You are invited to explore this website for an overview of my
activities and for opportunities to work with me as a graduate student,
post-doc, or visiting research scientist.
