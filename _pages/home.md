# <center> About this website</center> 

<p align="justify">

My name is Stephen Griffies and this website summarizes my research,
teaching, and mentoring activities.  I conduct scientific research in
ocean and earth system physics at the <a
href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/">NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory,</a> with a focus on ocean fluid mechanics and the large
scale ocean circulation. I also teach and mentor as a
faculty member in the <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University.
</a>

<br> <br>

You are invited to explore this website for an overview of my
activities and for opportunities to work with me as a graduate
student, postdoc, or visiting research scientist.  In particular, I
seek PhD students with an extremely strong training in theoretical
physics and applied mathematics as achieved during undergraduate
and/or masters studies.
