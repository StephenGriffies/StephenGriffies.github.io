<h3> Welcome</h3>

<p align="justify">

My name is Stephen Griffies.  This website summarizes my research,
teaching, and mentoring activities.  I conduct research in ocean and
climate physics at <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/">NOAA's
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory,</a> focusing on elements of
ocean fluid mechanics and the role of the ocean in the earth climate
system.  I teach and supervise graduate students and post-docs as part
of the faculty of the <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/">
Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at Princeton University</a>.
My work generally makes use of concepts and tools from mathematical
physics with an aim to deepen a scientific understanding of how the
ocean works.  As part of this work I hope to nurture an appreciation
of geophysical fluid mechanics within the broader context of
theoretical physics.

teaching as well as opportunities to work with me.
