# <center> Philosophy + Aims </center>

<p align="justify">

Much of my research has contribued to the science forming the
foundations of numerical models as well as the science of modeling as
an experimental process. Here I sample additional work that focuses
primarily on the use of models, along with theory and observations, to
reveal elements of how the ocean works.  These studies include those
focused on mesoscale eddy mechanics, mechanisms for sea level
variations and change, Southern Ocean dynamics, and studies of
Atlantic predictability.

<br> <br>

The projects listed here are typically hypothesis-based and curiosity
driven, thus providing a wealth of educational value for students,
post-docs, and early career scientists.  Hence, many of the projects
were led by younger colleages (in Princeton and elsewhere), with my
role focused on mentoring.

# <center>Eddy Mechanics</center>

<p align="justify">

Most of the ocean kinetic energy occurs within transient mesoscale
eddies, with lateral scales extending from tens of kilometers in the
high latitudes to hundreds of kilometers near the equator.  <a
href="https://vimeo.com/27076776"> This animation,</a> generated from
the GFDL CM2.6 coupled climate model, provides a compelling view on
mesoscale eddies in action.  These eddies have a significant impact on
the transport of momentum, vorticity, heat, freshwater, carbon,
nutrients, and biota throughout the oceans.  In the 1970s,
observational oceanographers first documented the presence of ocean
mesoscale eddies, which then prompted theoretical oceanographers to
focus on understanding eddy mechanics and parameterizing their effects
in climate models unable to resolve the eddying flow.

<br> <br>

Studies of ocean mesoscale eddy mechanics requires a rigorous
understanding of geophysical fluid mechanics along with strong skills
in mathematics, physics, and computational analysis.  Many of the
cutting edge research questions sit at the interface between the
mesoscale and the smaller sub-mesoscales and even touch into the
gravity wave scales. These questions relate to how fundamental
processes operate in the ocean (and atmosphere), and impact how we
understand and simulate the ocean and its role within the climate
system.

# <center>Sea Level</center>

<p align="justify">

Global mean sea level has been rising since the early 20th century due
to global climate change, and will continue to rise for decades to
centuries.  There are significant socio-economic impacts from sea
level rise on populations and environments in coastal areas and
islands.  Furthermore, many of the displaced populations stress
regions away from the coast.  Sea level change is thus one of the most
consequential effects of anthropogenic climate change for the 21st
century and beyond.

<br> <br>

Global sea level rise will be realized by no single location, with
diverse regional patterns affected by a suite of geophysical,
oceanographic, and anthropogenic mechanisms.  There are many basic and
applied questions to be addressed in the study of sea level, with
research benefiting from a sound understanding of geophysical fluid
mechanics, geophysics (e.g., geodesy), and coastal oceanography.

# <center> Southern Ocean</center>

<p align="justify">

The Southern Ocean is home to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC),
whose depth integrated mass transport is the world's largest, and the
Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (SOMOC), which plays
a key role in the earth's climate system through the
ventilation/sequestration of heat and carbon.  These two circulations
are tightly woven into the fabric of Southern Ocean climate dynamics,
with mechanisms affecting one also affecting the other.

<br> <br>

Closer to the Antarctic continent lives the Antarctic Slope Current,
which is a strong jet-like current flowing from east to west, largely
driven by coastal winds and feeding off the strong baroclinic front
between the shelf and open ocean.  The ASF separates the generally
warmer waters off-shelf from colder coastal waters, with cross-shelf
exchange of warm waters of interest for sea level studies due to the
potential to melt ice shelves and to allow more land ice to enter the
ocean.

## <center> CM2.6</center>

<p align="justify">

I am part of a few collaborative efforts that support my research on
Southern Ocean science. The first is the CM2.6 project that makes use
of a coupled climate model developed at GFDL, with the ocean model
component having a very righ mesoscale eddy activity.  This model has
been run long enough so that its output allows us to investigate the
role of ocean mesoscale eddies in various climate processes,
particularly those in the Southern Ocean where eddies are a leading
part of the momentum and tracer budgets. This model has provided the
seeds for a number of studies, some of which are ongoing. A full list
of the 40+ published papers <a
href="/assets/pdfs/CM2p6_project_list.pdf"> is available here.</a>

</p>

## <center>SOCCOM</center>

<p align="justify">

The second collaboration that supports my Southern Ocean research is
through Princeton University within the research team of <a
href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/team/sarmiento"> Prof. Jorge
Sarmiento.</a> This work has led to my being a collaborating PI for
the <a href="https://soccom.princeton.edu/">SOCCOM project (Southern
Ocean Carbon + Climate Observations and Modeling),</a> with SOCCOM
greatly expanding our capabilities at both observing and modeling the
Southern Ocean.

</p>

## <center>COSIMA</center>

<p align="justify">

A third collaboration is with scientists in Australia, where much of
our overlap concerns Southern Ocean research questions as supported
through the <a href="http://cosima.org.au/"> COSIMA (Consortium for
Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia) project.</a> An example of our
work together is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VMSF28J9H4">this animation</a>
of Southern Ocean dynamics generated from the ocean/sea-ice components
of the CM2.6 climate model. This animation beautifully reveals the
multi-layered and rich ocean dynamics in the Southern Ocean and near
the Antarctic continent.

</p>

## <center>DynOPO</center>

<p align="justify">

My research on the Southern Ocean took on a new level of intensity
when I spent eight weeks on a cruise to study deep ocean mixing
processes in the Orkney Passage region of the Scotia/Weddell
Seas. This trip, which was part as part of the British <a
href="https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/dynamics-of-the-orkney-passage-outflow/">DynOPO
Project,</a> taught me first hand the great value of seagoing
oceanography for informing theoretical and modeling efforts.  <a
href="https://dynopocruise2017.blogspot.com/">Here is a blog I wrote
while on the cruise.</a> This highly impactful life experience is one
that I hope to repeat in the near future, and one that I encourage
early career scientists to pursue even those solely interested in
theoretical work.

# <center>Predictability</center>

<p align="justify">

When I was a Princeton post-doc (1993-1996), Kirk Bryan and <a
href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/"> Eli Tziperman</a>
(on sabbatical at GFDL during 1993-1994) pointed me to questions
related to decadal and multi-decadal variations of the North Atlantic
climate due to fluctuations of the Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation (AMOC).  In the middle 1990s, these questions were largely
theoretical and model-based, given the lack of observational data.
Nonetheless, the model studies we conducted led to the first works on
decadal predictability, thus providing the seeds for ongoing efforts
to capture any source of predictability available at these time
scales.  As part of that work, I was led to collaborate with <a
href="https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/"> Tapio
Schneider, </a> then a Princeton graduate student, on fundamental
questions about predictability.  Tapio brought to these questions many
insights from information theory, with that work providing the seeds
for how we today measure predictability and predictable patterns.
