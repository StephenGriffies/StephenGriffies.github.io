# <center>Eddy Mechanics</center>


<p align="justify">

Most of the ocean kinetic energy occurs within transient mesoscale
eddies, with lateral scales extending from tens of kilometers in the
high latitudes to hundreds of kilometers near the equator.  <a
href="https://vimeo.com/27076776"> This animation,</a> generated from
the GFDL CM2.6 coupled climate model, provides a compelling view on
mesoscale eddies in action.  These eddies have a significant impact on
the transport of momentum, vorticity, heat, freshwater, carbon,
nutrients, and biota throughout the oceans.

## <center>Questions</center>

<p align="justify">

Studies of ocean mesoscale eddy mechanics requires a rigorous
understanding of geophysical fluid mechanics along with strong skills
in mathematics, physics, and computational analysis.  Many of the
cutting edge research questions sit at the interface between the
mesoscale and the smaller sub-mesoscales and even touch into the
gravity wave scales. These questions relate to how fundamental
processes operate in the ocean (and atmosphere), and impact how we
understand and simulate the ocean and its role within the climate
system.

<br> <br>

Here are a few of the questions that interest me concerning
eddy mechanics.  

<ul>

<li> How do mesoscale eddies interact with topography? With the
submesoscale?  With gravity waves? </li>

<li> How much diapycnal mixing is associated with mesoscale
eddies?</li>

<li> How much material transport is associated with coherent mesoscale
eddies?  Is that transport robust in the presence of submesoscale
processes and gravity waves? </li>

<li> How do mesoscale eddies vertically transport heat, carbon, and
other tracers, and what model resolution is required to accurately
represent this transport?  </li>

<li> How do we accurately parameterize transport from mesoscale eddies
for use in climate model simulations?  Is an energetic framework
effective for formulating closures? </li>


</ul>

# <center>Sea Level</center>

<p align="justify">

Global mean sea level has been rising since the early 20th century due
to global climate change, and will continue to rise for decades to
centuries.  There are significant socio-economic impacts from sea
level rise on populations and environments in coastal areas and
islands.  Furthermore, many of the displaced populations stress
regions away from the coast.  Sea level change is thus one of the most
consequential effects of anthropogenic climate change for the 21st
century and beyond.

## <center>Questions</center>

<p align="justify">

Global sea level rise will be realized by no single location, with
diverse regional patterns affected by a suite of geophysical,
oceanographic, and anthropogenic mechanisms.  There are many basic and
applied questions to be addressed in the study of sea level, with
research benefiting from a sound understanding of geophysical fluid
mechanics, geophysics (e.g., geodesy), and coastal oceanography.

<br> <br>

Here are a few of the questions that interest me concerning
sea level variations and change. 

<ul>

<li> Will extreme sea level events occur more frequently in the future
under a changing climate? </li>

<li> What are the mechanisms for regional sea level change, in
particular those affecting coastal regions?  </li>

<li> How will ice shelves and ice sheets respond to warming subsurface
ocean waters? </li>

<li> How does sea level along the coasts reflect sea level within the
ocean interior?</li>

<li> How will changes to the gravity field, arising from changes in
ice sheet masses, impact on the ocean circulation? </li>

<li> How accurate can we predict changes to coastal sea level? </li>

</ul>
