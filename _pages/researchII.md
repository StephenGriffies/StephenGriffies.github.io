I am part of a variety of collaborative efforts that support my
research on Southern Ocean science, including SOCCOM, COSIMA, and
DynOPO, each of which are discussed <a href="/collaborations/">
here.</a> The coupled model CM2.6 is a critical tool used for some of
these projects.  CM2.6 is notable for simulating a rich mesoscale eddy
field (see below image).  This model has been the source for 40+
research papers <a href="/assets/pdfs/CM2p6_project_list.pdf"> as
listed here,</a> many of which concern the Southern Ocean.

## <center>Questions</center>

<p align="justify">

The Southern Ocean is home to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC),
whose depth integrated mass transport is the world's largest, and the
Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (SOMOC), which plays
a key role in the earth system through the ventilation/sequestration
of heat and carbon.  These two circulations are tightly woven into the
fabric of Southern Ocean dynamics, with mechanisms affecting one also
affecting the other.

<br> <br>

Closer to the Antarctic continent lives the Antarctic Slope Current,
which is a strong jet-like current flowing from east to west, largely
driven by coastal winds, the strong baroclinic front between the shelf
and open ocean, and tides.  The ASF separates the generally warmer
waters off-shelf from colder coastal waters, with cross-shelf exchange
of warm waters of interest for sea level studies due to the potential
to melt ice shelves and to allow more land ice to enter the ocean.

<br> <br>

Here are a few of the questions that interest me concerning the
Southern Ocean. 

<ul>

<li> What are the fundamental force balances active in the Southern
Ocean, in particular relating to the role of bottom topography? </li>

<li> What are the dynamics of zonal jets in the Southern Ocean, and
how do these jets impact on the ventilation of carbon, heat, and
nutrients? </li>

<li> How will the depth integrated transport and meridional
overturning transport be modified under changes to both wind and
buoyancy forcing?  </li>

<li> How is the Southern Ocean, including along the continental shelf,
impacted by large scale patterns such as ENSO and the Southern Annual
Mode?  </li>

<li> What are the dynamical balances active within the Antarctic Slope
Curent?  How does the slope current interact with the ACC? </li>

<li> What mechanics are responsible for transport of heat across the
Antarctic continental shelf towards the base of ice shelves? How will
the associated processes change under altered forcing? </li>

</ul>

# <center>Predictability</center>

<p align="justify">

When I was a Princeton University post-doc (1993-1996), Kirk Bryan and
<a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/"> Eli Tziperman</a>
(on sabbatical at GFDL during 1993-1994) pointed me to questions
related to decadal and multi-decadal variations of the North Atlantic
due to fluctuations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
(AMOC).  In the middle 1990s, these questions were largely theoretical
and model-based, given the lack of observational data.  Nonetheless,
the model studies we conducted led to the first works on Atlantic
decadal predictability, thus providing the seeds for ongoing efforts
to capture any source of predictability available at these time
scales.  As part of that work, I was led to collaborate with <a
href="https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/"> Tapio
Schneider, </a> then a Princeton graduate student, on fundamental
questions about predictability.  Tapio brought to these questions many
insights from information theory, with that work providing the seeds
for how we today measure predictability and predictable patterns.

<br> <br>

I am presently not working on questions related to Atlantic decadal
predictability.  However, GFDL has a very active group focused on
these questions.
