#  <center> Philosophy + Aims </center>

<p align="justify">

As a <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/people/faculty">teacher,</a>
mentor, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html">book
author,</a> <a
href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/ocean-circulation-and-climate/siedler/978-0-12-391851-2">
book editor,</a> and <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/19422466/editorial-board/editorial-board">journal
editor,</a> I aim to foster a fundamental understanding of physical
concepts and their creative use in describing observed and simulated
ocean phenomena. Towards this aim, I strive to pedagogically
articulate the foundations of ocean fluid mechanics in both the
written and spoken word.  I am particularly interested in revealing
how concepts and tools from mathematical physics can be leveraged to
deepen our understanding of ocean physical processes and circulation.

</p>


#  <center> Cultivating a safe and grateful space for learning and research</center>

<p align="justify">

As part of my research, teaching, and mentoring, I aim to foster an
inclusive, friendly, generous, patient, and non-judgmental space for
students, postdocs, and researchers.  Key principles that support this
space include equity, diversity and inclusion, each of which are
intrinsically valuable and an essential feature of ethical research
and education.  I also acknowledge and honor past generations whose
efforts, some of which were sadly garnered through force and
oppression, have led to the rewarding research environment that I now
work.  It is my sincere hope that practicing the above principles
supports present and future generations in a way that helps to heal
past injustices.

<br> <br>

Cultivating an open, accepting, and grateful research and learning
space supports spontaneous brainstorming and learning while genuinely
appreciating contributions from individuals without regard to race,
ethnicity, culture, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, physical ability, age, socioeconomic status or
nationality.  Each participant in this space celebrates diversity and
nurtures an inclusive and resilient community that is better able to
produce fundamental scientific advances that are effectively
communicated to the global community.

</p>


#  <center>Mentoring</center>
<p align="justify">

I find it fulfilling to collaborate with scientists from across a
broad spectrum of experience, expertise, and backgrounds.  I
particularly seek to mentor and collaborate with students, postdocs,
and visiting researchers with passions for mathematical physics and
physical oceanography.  As a mentor, I aim to nurture a talent for
diving deep into the fundamentals of ocean physics and for creatively
uncovering their impacts on ocean circulation.  I support open and
honest working relations and aim for an environment where scientific
understanding and insights emerge from questions posed in a trusting
and non-judgmental space.

#  <center> GFM at Princeton</center>

<p align="justify">

Geophysical fluid mechanics (GFM) is a beautiful discipline of
theoretical physics that forms the intellectual foundation for
physical oceanography and meteorology. I teach the graduate GFM course
as part of Princeton University's AOS program. The first semester
develops mathematics, kinematics, tracer dynamics, momentum dynamics,
and vorticity dynamics relevant for understanding and describing the
physics of rotating and stratified fluids.  The second semester
focuses on waves and instabilities in geophysical fluid flows. I make
use of the following book for the lectures, and I welcome comments and
suggestions on this ongoing project <a
href="/assets/pdfs/GFM_lectures.pdf"> (Griffies, 2025)</a>.

#  <center> Lectures + Schools</center>

<p align="justify">

In addition to teaching as part of the Princeton Atmosphere/Ocean
Sciences faculty, I offer pedagogical lectures at schools and
workshops for students aiming to refine their understanding of ocean
physics, and for developing insights into how to run and analyze ocean
circulation models.  My most recent course (pre-pandemic) was at the
CLEX advanced ocean modelling summer school in Tasmania during
April/May 2019.

</p>


#  <center> Review Papers + Books</center>

<p align="justify">

The evolution of a scientific discipline is supported by review
articles and books that enable a new generation of scientists to
penetrate into the discipline and in turn to contribute novel insights.
Such publications also help establish a rigor that might otherwise be
lacking without a systematic synthesis of intellectual strands.  I
have participated in many review papers, lead authoring some and
mentoring the lead author on others.  I am also the author of a
monograph on ocean models <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html">(Griffies
2004)</a> and the co-editor of a book on ocean 
science <a
href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/ocean-circulation-and-climate/siedler/978-0-12-391851-2">
(Siedler, Griffies, Gould, and Church 2013).</a>
