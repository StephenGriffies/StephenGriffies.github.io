#  <center> Philosophy + Aims </center>

<p align="justify">

As a <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/people/faculty">teacher,</a>
mentor, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html">book
author,</a> <a
href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/ocean-circulation-and-climate/siedler/978-0-12-391851-2">
book editor,</a> and <a
href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/19422466/editorial-board/editorial-board">journal
editor,</a> I aim to foster a fundamental understanding of physical
concepts and their creative use in describing observed and simulated
ocean phenomena. Towards this aim, I strive to pedagogically
articulate the foundations of ocean fluid mechanics in both the
written and spoken word.  I am particularly interested in revealing
how concepts and tools from mathematical physics can be leveraged to
deepen our understanding of ocean physical processes and circulation.

#  <center>Mentoring</center>
<p align="justify">

I seek to mentor energetic students, post-docs, and visiting
professors with a strong background in mathematical physics and
physical oceanography.  My mentees have a passion and creative talent
for diving deep into the fundamentals of ocean physics and for
uncovering their impacts on ocean circulation and climate.

#  <center> GFM at Princeton</center>

<p align="justify">

Geophysical fluid mechanics (GFM) is a beautiful discipline of
theoretical physics and it forms the intellectual foundation for
physical oceanography and climate. I teach the first semester graduate
GFM course as part of Princeton University's AOS program. The course
develops mathematics, kinematics, tracer dynamics, momentum dynamics,
and vorticity dynamics relevant for understanding and describing the
physics of rotating and stratified fluids.  I make use of lecture
notes <a href="/assets/pdfs/GFM_lectures.pdf">
(Griffies 2019)</a> as well as textbooks such as that from <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/atmospheric-and-oceanic-fluid-dynamics/41379BDDC4257CBE11143C466F6428A4">Vallis
(2017).</a>

</p>


#  <center> Lectures + Schools</center>

<p align="justify">

In addition to teaching as part of the Princeton AOS faculty, I offer
pedagogical lectures at schools and workshops for students aiming to
refine their understanding of ocean and climate science, and for
developing insights into how to run and analyze ocean model
simulations.  My next scheduled course is at the <a
href="https://climateextremes.org.au/advanced-ocean-modelling-summer-school/">CLEX
advanced ocean modelling summer school</a> in Tasmania during
April/May 2019.

</p>


#  <center> Review Papers + Books</center>

<p align="justify">

The evolution of a scientific discipline is supported by review
articles and books that enable a new generation of scientists to
penetrate into the discipline and in turn to contribute novel insights.
Such publications also help establish a rigor that might otherwise be
lacking without a systematic synthesis of intellectual strands.  I
have participated in many review papers, lead authoring some and
mentoring the lead author on others.  I am also the author of a
monograph on ocean models <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7797.html">(Griffies
2004)</a> and the co-editor of a book on ocean climate
science <a
href="https://www.elsevier.com/books/ocean-circulation-and-climate/siedler/978-0-12-391851-2">
(Siedler, Griffies, Gould, and Church 2013).</a>
