Research Scientists and Engineers at the
[NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/)
have released a
[visualisation of the World Ocean Sea Surface Temperature](https://vimeo.com/27076776).

The dataset was created using the coupled climate model CM2.6, which
is based on the ocean model code MOM5 at a 0.1 degree global
configuration, coupled to a 50km finite volume atmospheric model.
