[This animation of the World Ocean Sea Surface Temperature](https://vimeo.com/27076776)
was generated from the coupled climate model CM2.6, which uses the <a
href="https://mom-ocean.github.io/"> Modular Ocean Model version 5
(MOM5)</a> configurated at 0.1 degree global horizontal resolution.
The ocean model is also coupled to a 50km finite volume atmospheric
model.  I love the way this animation reveals many beautiful and
compelling facets of large-scale ocean fluid mechanics.
