[This animation of Southern Ocean circulation features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VMSF28J9H4)
was generated by my Australian colleagues as part of the <a
href="http://cosima.org.au/"> COSIMA project</a> using the <a
href="https://mom-ocean.github.io/"> Modular Ocean Model version 5
(MOM5)</a> run at 0.1 degree global horizontal resolution.  It reveals
the multi-layered nature of ocean circulation, and in particular the
rich and complex nature of fluid flow near the Antarctic continent.
